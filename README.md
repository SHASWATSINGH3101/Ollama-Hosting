# Ollama-Hosting
This project shows how to run Ollama on a weak computer using Kaggle for free GPU hosting, Ngrok for secure tunneling, and Open Web UI for interaction. Itâ€™s a cost-effective, accessible solution for developers and researchers to manage AI models privately without relying on expensive hardware.
